# The coolest vision project (maybe ever?) Use your camera to see the world! 

This project is designed for visually inmpaired users, or anyone else who just wants a more seamless experience of using AI. This project lets you use entirely verbal commands; hold down on the screen, speak your question, release your thumb, and wait for an answer. Ask a question such as "is this banana ripe and ready to eat?" or "is this the Bible?".

Using your own device is required when testing.

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

3. Scan the expo app!
